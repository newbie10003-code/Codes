<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Robotic process automation (RPA) is the application of technologies to
  configure computer software or a “robot” to capture and interpret existing
  applications for processing a transaction, manipulating data, triggering responses
  and communicating with other digital systems. RPA combines intelligence including
  natural language processing, machine learning, autonomics and machine vision with
  automation. Software named as robot captures and interprets the customer
  requirements and initiates operations across multiple digital systems. These software
  bots which perform these activities can also be termed as virtual or digital workforce
  in today’s work environment.</p>
<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Revolution</strong></p>
<p>Robots are likely to be performing 45% of manufacturing tasks by 2025 (vs.
  10% today) [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#1" title="1">1</a>]. Merrill Lynch estimated the robots and AI solution market at
  US$153b by 2020. Machine learning and customer interface such as voice and facial
  recognition will bring a huge change in the banking and financial industry. Roboadvisors
  are a major technological disruptor for traditional wealth management and
  have the potential for US$255bn in assets under management (AUM) by 2018,
  implying &gt;100% CAGR, or 2% penetration of the total addressable market [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#1" title="1">1</a>].</p>
<p>Banks are looking for different ways to stay competitive and maximize profit
  with a reduction in cost. RPA are starting to change the way Banking, Financial
  Services and Insurance (BFSI) is doing business. The concept of robotics
  automation involves the combination of intelligence with automation. RPA can
  produce vast information, data, analysis and workflows which have proven to provide
  tangible benefits to banks as well as its customers. Over the past years, various
  acquisitions and mergers happened which led to an increase in competition in the
  banking industry. Banks are investing in RPA to keep up with constantly changing
  and competitive industry. Automated investment programs use algorithms to arrange
  individual investment portfolios. Digital investment solutions can help strengthen the
  relationship between credibility and service provided [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#2" title="2">2</a>].</p>
<p>High volume and repetitive tasks are better performed by robots. It improves
  service quality, high accuracy, faster turnaround time, multi-tasking and increases
  compliance.</p>
<p>The banking industry is under pressure to provide 24/7 services, their profit
  margins are going down and customer satisfaction surrender. RPA is today’s version
  of tech outsourcing. RPA is quick and cost effective with tangible return on
  investment (ROI) for banks. The more automation and reliability banking can bring
  into the customer experience, especially on mobile devices, will define the industry’s
  success for many years to come [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#3" title="3">3</a>]. Robots help manufacturing industry by
  increasing production with improved quality, process, and backend work. Banking
  sector now has years of data related to customer feedback, products and bank
  activities which can be further analyzed with the help of Business Intelligence (BI)
  tools and help in strategic decision-making. RPA can allow banks to monitor
  customer behavior, workforce efficiency and time taken to complete various banking
  operations from anywhere. Banks have put AI as a key element of daily operations
  and believe AI can be key to enhancing customer experience.</p>
<p>The primary objective behind exploring and building the RPA capability is to
  overcome the barrier of human intelligence scalability. The speed with which humans
  can perform the given tasks compared to the Robot has surpassed by performing the
  same task in a fraction of a second. RPA looks to overcome this very challenge with
  human intelligence by transferring the human intelligence to cognitive machines with supreme computational capabilities. It is the proxy for future banking workforce and
  customer service. It can better perform repetitive tasks, with higher accuracy, faster
  turnaround. In the evolution of the banking service industry, top performing banks
  are investing in this technology with the expectation of significant reduction in the
  cost of their operations.</p>
<p>At the same time, business customers’ adoption of this technology is
  important for the success of RPA in the banking industry. Technology is changing at
  a fast pace and people find it difficult to trust technology which is controlled by bots.
  When customers are satisfied with technology adoption, the benefits of technology
  are likely to be higher and more effective. The most challenging issue in the adoption
  of new technologies is understanding the attitude of customers towards new
  technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Research Question (RQ)</strong></p>
<p><em>What are the key factors that influence the adoption of RPA in the retail banking
  industry to enhance the customer experience?</em></p>
<p>Our research follows a quantitative approach with a strong empirical analysis
  to identify the key factors influencing RPA adoption in retail banking industry to
  enhance customer experience. A survey questionnaire, designed with research
  items was sent to the appropriate stakeholders like banks’ customers, IT
  professionals, analysts, senior management decision-makers and and industry
  experts to get their responses and better understanding of the problem from a
  customer’s perspective. Demographical items were also included to understand the
  responses better. The study was carried out with samples collected mostly from the
  Asia Pacific Region.</p>
<p>There are three significant contributions of this study. First, this research
  focuses on RPA technology which has not yet drawn enough IS research attention.
  As RPA research in the domain of IS is sparse, this study contributes theoretically by
  setting the foundation for future research in this area. Second, To the best of our
  knowledge, this is one of the foremost to explore adoption factors of RPA from a customer perspective. Third, by hypothesizing the effect of different identified factors,
  we restate the need for a thorough understanding of these antecedents for a
  successful adoption of RPA technology in the retail banking industry to enhance
  customer experience. Holistically, this study, by depicting the RPA adoption factors,
  will contribute to the field of retail banking and help in understanding technology
  adoption from a customer perspective.</p>
<h4>Review of Literature</h4>
<p><strong>Robotic Process Automation</strong></p>
<p>The revolution of the industry and its achievements are so numerous that their
  impact can hardly be overrated. Robotics research, aimed at finding solutions to the
  technical necessities is now focusing on human expectations and needs to meet the
  demanding customer market. Any task which is definable, repeatable and rule based
  is a good candidate of automation by RPA such as closing and opening of bank
  accounts and handling various processes in the customer service department. RPA
  results in efficient and error free service, improves compliance management,
  expedites repetitive office tasks at a much faster rate and improves business
  process along with service quality. Hence, cost is reduced and customer experience
  is enhanced [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#4" title="4">4</a>,<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#5" title="5">5</a>]. Employees can participate in more value-added services that
  involve customer interaction, solutions and decision-making. This will allow banks to
  offer the best experience to their customers. As employees can focus on more
  customer facing roles, it is most likely to enhance customer satisfaction, acquisition
  and retention. The ability to collect and mine vast data and provide a complete audit
  is especially useful in areas like compliance and regulatory reporting. High volume,
  manually intensive, prone to risks and human errors processes are prime candidates
  for RPA. When it is enabled with AI, it can virtually eliminate processing errors,
  hence, improving accuracy and efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Retail Banking Industry</strong></p>
<p>Retail banking is a service industry focused towards the customer’s money
  and its management [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#6" title="6">6</a>]. With the increasing competition in the retail banking
  industry and rapid technological evolution, how do banks innovate to meet these
  challenges? Technological innovation in the retail banking industry was spurred on
  by the need to reduce cost and increase performance. Cost savings came largely
  through back office automation. Online banking or internet banking, which allows
  customers to monitor and perform various financial transactions is widely used. Over
  the past two decades, remote access has migrated from the telephone to the
  personal computer and most recently to the mobile smart phone [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#7" title="7">7</a>]. Most recently,
  with innovation in technology, banks are considering the adoption of RPA to
  automate repetitive processes.</p>
<p><strong>Consumer Expectations in the Retail Banking Industry</strong></p>
<p>The most important force of change in the banking industry is the rapid
  evolution of customers wants and desires. Customers are demanding anytimeanywhere
  delivery of financial services with an increased variety of products and
  services. Today, banks cannot deny the unprecedented benefits derived from
  implementing and adopting RPA tools in their environment. This includes corporate
  banking, retail banking, wealth management and other banking related services
  involving customer interaction. With the implementation of RPA, it enables Banks to
  achieve customers’ demands. Cost and fees charged by banks from its customers is
  one of the factors influencing customer satisfaction [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#8" title="8">8</a>].</p>
<p>Perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness are the factors affecting
  intentions to use the Smartphone banking services [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#9" title="9">9</a>]. Perceived usefulness, and
  attitude are the most significant drivers of intentions to adopt m-banking services in
  developed and developing countries [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#10" title="10">10</a>]. RPA will allow banks to dramatically
  reduce processing time and enhance customer service with higher accuracy. Banks
  will be able to handle large volume, repetitive and tedious jobs with the same
  resources. They can also learn how to improve performance and accuracy with little or no human input. In addition, multi-lingual language processing and voice
  recognition capabilities allow robots to interact and conduct seemingly intelligent
  conversations with customers.</p>
<p><strong>Research Problem</strong></p>
<p>From the literature review, it is understood that new technologies have been
  introduced in the retail banking services sector. In order to stay competitive, banks
  will have to adopt these new technologies to reap the gains which includes reduction
  in cost, increased performance and improved customer experience. RPA has
  penetrated the Healthcare, Insurance and Telecommunication industries. Customer
  readiness is also a contributing factor for the successful adoption of a new
  technology. This study would consider the challenges of enhancing the customer
  experience through the adoption of RPA in the retail banking industry. The factors
  (independent variables) identified are security and privacy, reliability, usefulness and
  human-like interaction. Details on the independent variables referenced are covered
  in the Research Model and Hypotheses section.</p>
<h4>Research Model and Hypotheses</h4>
<p><strong>Research Model and Hypotheses definition</strong></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1</strong> is the research model on which this research study is built upon.
  Based on the literature review, the dependent variable has been identified as ‘RPA
  adoption by the Retail Banking Industry to enhance customer experience’. The
  various independent variables (which are factors influencing the dependent variable)

<p>RPA are the alternative investments for bank to deal with higher volume at
  lower cost and remain competitive in the banking industry. It is the future of customer
  service. AI and the advancement in robots made the financial services more efficient
  including Credit risk checking, fraud detection, robot advisor and analyst. Roboadvisors
  are a major technological disruptor for traditional wealth management.
  Banks are investing in RPA to expand the service and starting a trend to pay
  attention in creating an ideal customer experience, generational difference and
  expectation. Customers have become more demanding for prompt and reliable
  services.</p>
<p><strong>Security and Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Security and privacy are one of the important factors that influence customer
  experience. Based on literature reading, security and privacy are the primary
  concerns of customers in adopting the banking service [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#11" title="11">11</a>]. Perception of internet

<p>RPA can be used for data collection and analysis but customers are
  concerned about their personnel data security and privacy. However, customers are
  looking forward towards new technologies such as chat bots and facial recognition,
  but banks should place strong protection for security and privacy of their data. The
  following hypotheses are based on the above discussion:</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis 1 (H1): </strong>A better protected, secured and privacy banking solutions (by
  using RPA) are positively related to customer experience.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis 2 (H2): </strong>Security and Privacy improvements (by using RPA) are
  positively related to automation and human-like interaction.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis 3 (H3): </strong>Security and Privacy (by using RPA) is positively related to
  better reliability and availability of banking products and services</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis 4 (H4): </strong>Security and privacy (by using RPA) is positively related to the
  data and usefulness of banking products and services.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability</strong></p>
<p>Reliability and ease of use influence customer experience after security and
  privacy [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#11" title="11">11</a>]. RPA can be utilized to unify their investment advice globally to improve
  credibility, increase regulatory compliance, efficiency and customer satisfaction
  [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#8" title="8">8</a>,<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#22" title="22">22</a>]. RPA is cost-effective; the automation software reduces the bank’s processing
  costs by 80 percent [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#4" title="4">4</a>]. RPA allows low incident of error and improved business

  technological service, responsiveness, reliability and trustworthiness satisfaction [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#8" title="8">8</a>].
  Software robot can work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and 365 days a year [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#4" title="4">4</a>]. For a customer agent who is searching for a financial product that best meets
  their need, Bot can autonomously accomplish this task by searching the relevant
  information and answering specific questions promptly [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#23" title="23">23</a>].</p>
<p>RPA can improve credibility by unifying the investment advice of banks. It can
  minimize or eliminate error and provide customized solution to customers. Also, a
  bot can operate 24/7 and hence improve reliability. The following hypotheses are
  based on the above discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis 5 (H5):</strong> The reliability and availability (of customized products and
  services solution using RPA) is positively related to enhancing customer experience.</p>
<p><strong>Usefulness</strong></p>
<p>Usefulness is the factor affecting continuance intention to use the Smartphone
  banking services [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#18" title="18">18</a>]. Data Mining is classification, clustering, association analysis,
  time series analysis, and outlier analysis. The biggest challenges are to access or
  extract large scale data, ensure security of sensitive information and to handle
  incomplete data [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#16" title="16">16</a>]. RPA combines automation with the adaptability and awareness
  of AI. Each task the robot executes produces data that, when gathered, allows for an
  analysis. This drives better decision-making in the areas of the processes being
  automated [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#4" title="4">4</a>]. Three reasons for embedding AI into user interface are to gain data
  analysis and insights, increase productivity and cost benefit savings [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#24" title="24">24</a>]. Customer
  prefers customized product and services from banks that suits their needs [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#18" title="18">18</a>].</p>
<p>RPA with AI can collect large data that can be analysed for better decisionmaking.
  Robo-advisors can utilize data to provide customized solution which can
  best suit the needs of customers, hence increase the usefulness of banking services.
  Usefulness of products and services affects the customer’s continuance intention to
  use the banking services.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis 6 (H6): </strong>Improved usefulness by data analytics and data mining (to
  customize products and services as per customer’s need using RPA) is positively
  related to customer experience.</p>
<p><strong>Human-like Interaction</strong></p>
<p>Customers prefer human interactions to complete their tasks. AI creates
  human-like customer experience and can be used to understand intentions and
  emotions of customers. It accelerates technology adoption [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#24" title="24">24</a>]. The human’s
  emotion about technology acceptance is the factor that determines early perceptions
  about the ease of use of a new system. Algorithms and apps could replace half of
  the banking jobs over the next 10 years [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#25" title="25">25</a>,<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#26" title="26">26</a>]. AI can create outputs beyond what a
  human brain can [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#27" title="27">27</a>]. Wealthy individuals will always prefer to consult a human as
  their complex financing needs may not be easily replicated by a robo-adviser [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#2" title="2">2</a>,<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#27" title="27">27</a>].
  Banks deploy AI to deepen the understanding of customers by monitoring crowd
  sourcing complaints and develop sentimental analysis [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#28" title="28">28</a>].</p>
<p>Based on literature review we understand that AI cannot replace human
  completely in all the tasks but it can reduce its interaction dramatically to complete
  the task. It is able to read, learn and understand intentions and emotions of
  customers. It can create human-like interaction and experience, hence influence the
  customer experience.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis 7 (H7): </strong>The human-like interaction by implementing RPA is positively
  related to customer experience.</p>
<p>AI brings in renewed focus on customer experience. Based on certain data
  inputs available from the customer history, personalized communications and advice,
  enabled by AI, can be reflected by Robot advisors. For example, online wealth
  management services that provide automated algorithm-based portfolio
  management advice without the help of a human counterpart. Many of the larger
  financial institutions globally are using AI to improve the personalized offers and
  communication. Going forward, it is believed that the banks will be focusing on
  custom marketing and solution development to improve the customer experience as
  well as increased revenue by offering customized products for targeted customers.</p>
<p>The tedious process of handling and communicating with a new customer to
  the bank can now become a highly personalized interaction based on the individual’s activity post opening. This level of personalization was almost impossible to achieve
  without the benefits of machine learning and AI.</p>
<p>Here are six key applications of AI in the Banking industry that will
  revolutionize the industry in the present and near future:</p>
<p>(1) Anti-Money Laundering Pattern Detection;</p>
<p>(2) Better Customer interaction using self-service Chabot;</p>
<p>(3) Algorithmic Trading - Predictive Financial Market Behaviour;</p>
<p>(4) Fraud detection;</p>
<p>(5) Know Your Customer Process;</p>
<p>(6) Disbursals and Payments – Individual or Corporate.</p>
<h4>Research Method, Data Analysis and Results</h4>
<p>The research model was tested using a survey questionnaire. The survey
  instrument was constructed by identifying relevant measurements from a
  comprehensive literature review. The questionnaire consisted of five parts; first four
  parts related to the four independent variables and the last part was on
  demographics. There were a total of 16 questions and a 5-point Likert scale was
  used to measure the survey items. An explanation on the subject and the purposes
  of the research were mentioned at the start of the survey for the better awareness of
  this study. In addition, the voluntary nature of the survey and the assurance of
  privacy of data were also stated. The questionnaires were circulated to banks’
  customers, IT professionals, analysts and senior management decision-makers. We
  reached out to a target sample size of 150+ by providing an online link to the survey
  through email invitations.</p>
<p>We also had discussions with RPA experts working on projects with banks.
  Secondary data had been taken from research reports, case studies, articles, and
  journals.</p>
<p>For statistical analysis, the ADANCO, a software for variance based structural
  equation modelling (SEM) was used to construct the data model, run and validate
  the hypothesis testing, measure reliability of data, overall goodness of fit test and the
  assessment of discriminant validity.</p>
<p>Out of a total of 150+ targeted customers, 112 responses were received.
  More than 50% of the participants performed banking transactions <strong>(Table 1)</strong> at least
  once in 4 months. Majority of the participants <strong>(Table 2)</strong> were from the Asia Pacific
  region (97%) while others were from America and Africa (3%). The primary role <strong>(Table 3)</strong> of these participants were Managers (28%), Consultant (21%), Analyst
  (21%) and Marketing/Sales (18%) working in <strong>(Table 4)</strong> Information technology
  (40%), Banking and Finance sector (21%). Their income <strong>(Table 5)</strong> was in the range
  of $50,000 - $100,000 (46%) and above $100,000 (28%). Majority of the participants <strong>(Table 6)</strong> were in the range of 25-35years (46%).</p>

<p><strong>Data Reliability</strong></p>
<p>In this analysis, we use Cronbach’s alpha to measure reliability or consistency
  of survey responses. There are different reports about the acceptable values of alpha, ranging from 0.70 to 0.95 [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#29" title="29">29</a>] (Cronbach, 1951).

<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>The research findings provide insights to the bank on how the adoption of
  RPA will impact the customer experience in the retail banking industry. The main
  objective of banks is to remain competitive and increase their profitability at lower
  cost. One of the ways they can achieve this is by introducing RPA for their daily
  operations. RPA replaces work performed by people; which are high in volume and
  repetitive. These are better performed by Robots which reduces delivery time and
  hence provide cost effective operations [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#22" title="22">22</a>]. The successful adoption of this new
  technology can also be part of a bank’s competitive strategy which in turn will bring
  benefits to the bank and its customers.</p>
<p>Customers demand reliable and fast service. AI and RPA can provide prompt
  service solutions 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and 365 days a year [<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#8" title="8">8</a>,<a href="https://www.icommercecentral.com/open-access/robotic-process-automation-a-study-of-the-impact-on-customer-experience-in-retail-banking-industry.php?aid=87176#22" title="22">22</a>].
  Thus, overcoming the constraint of a human, RPA will eliminate or minimize complications with time-zone differences, cultural and language barriers. This will
  enhance customer experience as a customer is able to get the service from bank
  anytime anywhere as per their schedule.</p>
<p>The research found that reliability and availability (0.382) had the highest
  influence on customer experience due to the implementation of RPA. Integrating
  control, intrinsic motivation, and emotion into the technology acceptance model are
  the factors that determine early perceptions about the ease of use of a new system
  [26]. This is indicated by data and usefulness (0.299). Security and privacy (0.199)
  followed by human-like interaction (0.174). Customers’ perception of banking
  services is changing with rapid advancement and changes in technology. It is
  necessary for the banking industry to meet and understand customers’ expectations
  and to enhance their overall experience. Customers want customized products,
  prompt services, irrespective of location and time barrier, assurance of security and
  protection to their personal data and lower costs without compromise on quality of
  service. Therefore, it becomes crucial for banks to pay attention to these factors and
  enhance customers’ experience while adopting and implementing new technologies
  such as RPA across banking functions and processes.</p>
<h4>Implications for Retail Banking Industry</h4>
<p>Despite the much-hyped expectation in terms of value delivery by RPA
  technology, and increasing use cases, there is still slack in the mainstream adoption
  of RPA technology in the banking industry. Literature in the past, done from the
  customer perspective, suggests that the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of
  use of any new technology are important factors for its adoption. It is not only
  important to understand the factors which influence the adoption intentions of RPA,
  but it is imperative to understand the ways in which a bank can address and handle
  such factors to build a business model to increase its overall value delivery efficiency
  and gain competitive advantage. This research is predicated on these significant
  theoretical and practical problems related to RPA adoption. Our current study
  examines four factors that influence adoption of RPA in the retail banking industry,
  namely security and privacy, reliability, usefulness, human-like interaction. The paper outlines some important implications for both research and practice.</p>
<p><strong>Implications for Research</strong></p>
<p>First, the current state of RPA research in the Information Systems (IS) field is
  sparse. The application of RPA in the financial service sector is gathering pace but
  most banks are still in the early stages of its adoption. This research augments
  insights from IS by understanding the customer acceptance and adoption of this
  innovative technology. As RPA research in the domain of IS is sparse, this study
  contributes theoretically by setting the foundation for future research in this area.
  Second, the study highlights the factors that can influence the adoption intentions of
  technologies like RPA. We extend the literature on different factors along with
  literature on RPA itself by presenting a research model <strong>(Figure 1)</strong> that provides a
  theoretical basis for understanding the antecedents of adoption intentions in the
  context of RPA. Future research can examine these characteristics in depth to
  expand the list. Third, the research presents a research model<strong> (Figure 1)</strong>. This model
  can be used to study the adoption of other technologies for the retail banking
  industry.</p>
<p><strong>Implications for Practice</strong></p>
<p>In addition to having implications for research, the study has various important
  implications for the banks, its customers, IT professionals, analysts and senior
  management decision-makers. First, though 21st Century is a technology driven era
  and banks are trying to innovate to survive in the cut-throat competition, the RPA
  technology is one area that holds plenty of potential and still not tapped to the fullest.
  The current study is predicated on this gap. This paper emphasizes the significance
  of RPA technologies and what factors banks should consider to facilitate the easy
  adoption of this interactive technology to enhance customer experience. Second, the
  study unambiguously highlights factors that are key drivers for the adoption of RPA
  and urges banks, senior management decision-makers, to seriously consider these
  factors for successful adoption of RPA for better value delivery. The study emphasises that security and privacy is the primary concern of the customers and is
  positively related to automation and human-like interaction as well as reliability of
  banking products and services. So, there is a need to increase the focus on security
  and privacy while integrating RPA into the retail banking industry. The reliability of
  customised products and services is a key factor influencing customer experience.
  Such customised products and services can be created through improved data
  analytics and data mining. Human-like interaction is another important factor that
  would enhance customer experience.</p>
<h4>Limitations and Scope for Future Research</h4>
<p>This research mainly focused on collecting data within Asia Pacific, 97% of
  responses were from the Asia Pacific region. This can be further expanded by
  collecting data from other regions such as America, Europe and Africa. This
  research focused on factors that influence customer experience, data security and
  privacy, reliability, availability, data mining and usefulness. It can be further
  researched on other factors such as ease of use, solution stability and robustness,
  optimization of resources and employee productivity.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is increasingly a strategic priority for
  banks to maintain competitive advantage and increase profitability. The research
  proposes and tests the adoption of RPA in the retail banking sector to enhance
  customer experience. The conceptualization of factors influencing the adoption
  intention provides direction to banks, IT professionals and senior management
  decision makers, technology practitioners and researchers to focus on the customer
  perspective. Furthermore, the structural model examination validated the relationship
  between various proposed factors and the adoption intention of RPA, thereby
  highlighting the serious need to devise effective strategies for successful adoption
  and value creation through the technology. The results of the structural relationship
  can serve as a starting point for banks to formulate their strategies around the prominent factors, including security and privacy, reliability, usefulness and humanlike
  interaction. The paper provides several directions for researchers for further
  studies in this focus area of the adoption, implementation, and impact of a potentially
  beneficial RPA technology.</p>
