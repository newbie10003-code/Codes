- Basic History
    1. React was designed by Jorden Walke, a SWE at Facebook
    2. It was first deployed for the FB news feed around 2011
    3. In 2013, React was open-sourced at the JS Conference

- React is a popular JS library for building modern web apps
- React allows developers to create user interfaces using a component-based approach
- React is known for its performance and flexibility, and it is widely used in web development for both small and large applications

- Key Features
    1. Component-based architecture: React applications are built using reusable components. Components encapsulate a part of the user interface and can manage their own state and logic.
    2. Uses a declarative approach: In declarative programming, you describe what you want the end result to look like, and the underlying system takes care of the details
    3. Virtual DOM(heart of React, very important):React uses a virtual DOM to manage update to the actual DOM efficiently. When the state or props of a component change, React updates the virtual DOM first and then compares it with 
        - Advantages:
            1. 
            2. 


- Document Object Model
    1. It is a model that defines HTML and XML documents as a tree structure, where each node of the tree is an object which represents a part of the document
    2. The DOM, is an interface that allows the developers to interact and control the elements of the web
    - Disadvantages
        * Whenever a child element is updated then all of the parent elements are rendered all over again which take time. Virtual DOM solves this issue

- Virtual DOM
    1. The virtual DOM, often abbreviated as VDOM, is a simplified, lightweight, in-memory representation of

- React Libraries
    1. React library
        - This script includes the React development library
        - It provides the necessary functions and classes for writing React code in your applications
        - Since the file is the development version, it includes helpful debugging and error messages to aid in development
    2. ReactDOM library
        - This script include the ReactDOM development library
        - ReactDOM is an extension of React that provides 

- JSX
    1. JSX stands for Javascript XML
    2. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React
    3. 

- Production Mode
    1. 

// Creating a react app
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
const a = document.getElementById("ab");
const b = ReactDOM.createRoot(a);
b.render(<h1> This is heading </h1>);

- Components
    1. In react, components are building blocks of user interfaces.
    2. They are reusable, self-contained pieces of code that encapsulate a specific functionality or piece of the user interface
    3. Class components and function components

- Creating a function component
// In heading.js
import React from react;
function Heading()
{
    return <h1> This is heading </h1>;
}
export default Heading;
// In index.js
b.render(<Heading/>);

// npm start in myproject folder;
