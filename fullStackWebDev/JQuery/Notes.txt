JQUERY

 - Lightweight js library
 - Simplifies js programming
 - JS -> document.getElementbyID("id")
 - JQuery -> $("#id")
 - Browser Independent
 - Either download (development version - uncompressed and human readable) or use CDN to acess jquery library
 - Production version (minimised and compressed version) is used at the time of website deployment
 - CDN is preferred because:
    1. No local resource usage
    2. Loading time faster
 - Syntax - $(Selector).action() # $ sign denotes jquery function and action function performs some action on it
 - Syntax - $(document).ready(function(){
                // JQuery methods go here
            });

            or

            $(function()
            {
                // JQuery methods go here
            })

AJAX

 - Asynchronous JS and XML
 - Art of exchanging data with server and updating parts of a web page - without reloading the whole page
 - Examples - Gmail, Maps, YT, Facebook
 - JQuery is used to implement AJAX since it has the easiest and simplest syntax, other ways are XML
 - Browser Independent
 - Jitna required portion ho webpage ka sirf utna hi update karo
 - Three methods:
    1. load()
        $(Selector).load(URL, data, callback)
        - Data = send additional data to the server along with the request (optional)
        - The callback functions have three parameters:
            a. responseTxt
            b. 
            c. 
    2. get()
    3. post()
