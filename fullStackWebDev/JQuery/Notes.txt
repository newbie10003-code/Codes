JQUERY

 - Lightweight js library
 - Simplifies js programming
 - JS -> document.getElementbyID("id")
 - JQuery -> $("#id")
 - Browser Independent
 - Either download (development version - uncompressed and human readable) or use CDN to acess jquery library
 - Production version (minimised and compressed version) is used at the time of website deployment
 - CDN is preferred because:
    1. No local resource usage
    2. Loading time faster
 - Syntax - $(Selector).action() # $ sign denotes jquery function and action function performs some action on it
 - Syntax - $(document).ready(function(){
                // JQuery methods go here
            });

            or

            $(function()
            {
                // JQuery methods go here
            })

AJAX

 - Asynchronous JS and XML
 - Art of exchanging data with server and updating parts of a web page - without reloading the whole page
 - Examples - Gmail, Maps, YT, Facebook
 - JQuery is used to implement AJAX since it has the easiest and simplest syntax, other ways are XML
 - Browser Independent
 - Jitna required portion ho webpage ka sirf utna hi update karo
 - Three methods:
    1. load()
        $(Selector).load(URL, data, callback)
        - Data = send additional data to the server along with the request (optional)
        - The callback functions have three parameters:
            a. responseTxt
            b. 
            c. 
    2. get()
    3. post()

XML

 - XML stands for Extensible Markup Language (we can define our own tags)
 - XML is a markup language like HTML
 - XML was designed to store and transport data
 - XML was designed to be self-descriptive
 - XML is a W3C recommendation

 - Difference between XML and HTML:
    1. XML was designed to carry data - with focus on what data is
    2. HTML was designed to display data - with focus on how data looks
    3. XML tags are not predefined tags like HTML tags are

 - We can create our own tags
 - Example:
    <note>
        <to>Tove</to>
        <from>Jani</from>
        <heading>Reminder</heading>
        <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
    </note>

    <note>
        <date>12-09-2002</date>
        <hour>23</hour>
        <to>Tove</to>
        <from>Jani</from>
        <heading>Reminder</heading>
        <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
    </note>

    <message> salaray < 1000 </message> # Error
    <message> salary &lt 1000 </message> # Correct
 - Syntax Rules:
    1. XML documents must have a root element
    2. The XML Prolog (optional but if it exists, first line in the document)
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    3. XML elements must have a closing tags
    4. XML tags are case sensitive
    5. To be continued...

 - Well formed vs Valid XML documents:
    1. An XML document with correct syntax is called 'Well-formed'
    2. A "well formed" document is not the same as a "valid" XML document
    3. A "valid" xml document must be "well formed". In addition, it must conform to a document type definition
    4. The validity of XML document is checked by XML Parser
    4. There are two Difference
        a. DTD - document type definition. Defines the structure and the legal elements and attributes of an XML document

        b. XML Schema - An XML-based alternative to DTD

 - Advantages of XML Schema:
    1. Data types can be defined
    2. Written in XML, while DTD has to be defined in a separate structure type
    3. XML Schema are Extensible to additions
    4. XML schemas support data types
    5. It is easier to convert data between different data types
    6. XML schemas support namespaces
    7. You don't have to learn a new language
