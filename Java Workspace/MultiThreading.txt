-> Multithreading in java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously
-> So, independent work can be executed simultaneously 
-> Multithreading in java is a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously to maximize utilisation of CPU
-> Example: Kitchen, waiter, chef
    - Waiter will be in ideal situation
    - Main thread (if no other thread is there, then work will be done by only one main thread!)
    - Process, multiprocess, multitasking, Multithreading {Softwares, single OS, multitasking}

-> Two ways to create a thread in java:
    1. By implementing Runnable interface
        - Have to provide override definition of run method
    2. By extending Thread class
        - Have to provide override definition of run method

-> Threads are managed by JVM.
