Data Types in Java?
	- Data types in Java are defined as specifiers that allocate different sizes and 
	types of values the can be stored in the variable or an identifier.
	
	int a = 11;
	int (data type) a (identifier/variable name) = 11(value);
	
	firstVariable() = correct;
	FirstVariable() = not correct;
	
	Class FirstClass{//Correct
	}
	Class firstClass{//incorrect
	}
	
	-Java has a rich set of data types. Data types in Java can be divided into two parts:
		-Primitive Data Types: which include integer,character, boolean and float
		-Non-Primitive Data types: which includes classes, arrays and interfaces. Example = string,Array etc;
		
					 Java Data Types
		Data Type     Default Value         Default Size  
		byte                0                  1 byte
		short				0				   2 bytes
		int 				0				   4 bytes
		long				0L				   8 bytes
		float 				0.0f			   4 bytes
		double  			0.0d			   8 bytes
		boolean				false			   1 bit
		char				'\u0000'		   2 bytes
		
	- 1byte = 8 bits = 10101010 {8 binary bits capacity}
		1
		87878778787,0101010
		1
		00000001
		
	- 0 or 0 = 0
	- 0 or 1 = 1
	- 1 or 0 = 1
	- 1 or 1 = 1
	
	- 00000000 [min] 0
	
	-boolean 1 bit:
		1->true
		0->false

	Precedence in Java follows left to right rule and it applies only when the operators have same precedence
	</> code
		/* Control Statements and Conditional Statements:
		-Java provides Three types of control flow statements
		for, while,do-while
		Some another keywords used in flow statements are 
		break and continue.
		break-> breaks the innermost loop
		continue-> skips one iteration of innermost loop
		
	##Wrapper classes in Java
		* The wrapper class in Java provides the mechanism to convert primitive into object and object into primitive.
		* Why?
		* Because we want to use predefined methods of those objects
		* - boolean data types -> Boolean obj; -> obj.toString();
		
		Integer: wrapper class of int primitive data type
		Syntax: Integer i = Integer.valueOf(a);// Converting int into Integer
		or
		Integer i = new Integer("");//previous version still can use.
		
		another syntax 
			Integer j = 10;//autoboxing 
			
			
	## Scanner class
		 
		 Functions
		 nextLine() Read user input [to read Strings]
		 next() Read next token from the input entered by the user
		 nextBoolean() Reads a boolean value from the user
		 nextByte() Reads a byte value from the user
		 nextDouble() Reads a double value from the user
		 nextFloat() Reads a float value from the user
		 nextInt() Reads a int value from the user
		 nextLine() Reads a String value from the user
		 nextLong() Reads a long value from the user
		 nextShort() Reads a short value from the user
		 
		 Before using these functions we need to create object of scanner class
		 	first import util library and scanner class
		 	import java.util.Scanner;
		 	
		 	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);//creating object of scanner class
		 	String s = sc.next();// reading until space is found
		 	String fullname = sc.nextLine();//reading until linebreak if found

	/*
	It is called when an instance of the class if created
	At the time of calling the constructor, memory for the object if allocated in the memory for the object is allocated in the memory
	It is a special type of method which is used to initialize the object
	Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called
	Two types of Constructors in Java
		-Parameterized Constructor
		- Default Constructor
